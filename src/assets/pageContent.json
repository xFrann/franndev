My first learned language though was Java, however I never had the chance to build something significant with it as there were much better alternatives for the software I needed to create. <br/> All the websites (both mine and customers' one) get hosted on my own server, which serves them using nginx, the connections are proxied with cloudflare. This also acts as the mail server, so far with few mailboxes (under 50). <br/> I like working mainly on the backend, but since this is not enough to create an useful app, I have to be some sort of a full stack developer (jack of all trades, expert of none) as you can also see from the poor design skills üòÖ"
